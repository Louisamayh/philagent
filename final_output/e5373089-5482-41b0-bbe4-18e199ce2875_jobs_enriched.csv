A web search for 'Bespoke machinery manufacturer Burntwood Staffordshire' identified Unitech Machinery as the primary candidate. Their website confirms they are 'surface finishing systems experts' who 'design, manufacture, and install bespoke systems' for industries including automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing, all from their 'state-of-the-art Burntwood facility'. This company is a near-perfect match for the location and the specialized bespoke manufacturing requirement. Although specific software like Solidworks and AutoCAD were not explicitly found on their public 'About Us' page, the combination of bespoke machinery manufacturing and the precise location makes Unitech Machinery the highly likely employer."
